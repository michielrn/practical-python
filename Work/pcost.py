# Exercise 1.27: Reading a data file
# Now that you know how to read a file, letâ€™s write a program to perform a simple calculation.

# The columns in portfolio.csv correspond to the stock name, number of shares, 
# and purchase price of a single stock holding. 
# Write a program called pcost.py that opens this file, reads all lines, 
# and calculates how much it cost to purchase all of the shares in the portfolio.

# Hint: to convert a string to an integer, use int(s). 
# To convert a string to a floating point, use float(s).

# Your program should print output such as the following:

# Total cost 44671.15
total_cost = 0.0
with open('Data/portfolio.csv', 'rt') as f:
    next(f)
    for line in f:
        purchase = line.split(',')
        total_cost = total_cost + int(purchase[1]) * float(purchase[2])

print(f'Total cost: {total_cost}')
